::Ramsdale Inn
The inn is a rather elaborate place. Like on the deck, the place is lit up with ball-shaped paper lamps. The rest of the inn is a smooth, polished wood, which is kept immaculately clean. A Ramadium girl in a maid uniform works nearby; there's no doubt that she's the reason this place looks so nice.

A Ramadium man smiles at you from the front desk. "Welcome, <<if $faceNum >= 3 && $bodyHairNum == 0 && $muscleNum == 0>>ma'am<<else>>sir<</if>>. Rooms are $<<print $ramsdaleInn.rent>> a night if you're interested."

Everything - from the bed to the wardrobe - is immaculately clean. It's clear that the owner takes great pride in keeping the inn tidy.
