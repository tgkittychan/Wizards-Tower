It's still all black and brown, but where the top was a respectable button up suitable for a man, the women's is a tight blouse that'll bring attention to your chest. The skirt is even worse; it's pretty short, stopping at your upper thigh, and has brown trim at the bottom. Everyone can see your legs, meaning they all know how smooth and feminine they are.<br><br>" +

It's entirely pink, with white dots all over it and the words 'I <3 My Nappies' written across the chest. As if that weren't humiliating enough, the bottom of it poofs out obscenely, outlining what can only be a big, poofy baby diaper.<br><br>" +
